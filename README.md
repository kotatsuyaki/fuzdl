# Development

## Internal Documentation

Documentation generated by `rustdoc` for the master branch is available at <https://kotatsuyaki.github.io/fuzdl-rs/fuzdl>.


## Unit Tests

The unit tests in `src/states.rs` has special requirements to be run.

- The tests depend on `chromedriver` being available in `$PATH`.
- The tests can only be run single-threaded, since each test independently runs and stops its own instance of `chromedriver`.
  Use `cargo test -- --test-threads 1` to run the tests single-threaded.
